Project 1 Unit 3: Add code to ensure thread safety

Info: 
    This is a eclipse workspace directory. Please use eclipse to 
    load it.

    We use src/javasmartphone/p1u3/driver/Driver.java to test our code.
    The idea is as following:
    
        We have two threads: t1 and t2. 
        t1 try to modify the optionSet name from Color to T1Color while
        t2 try to modify the optionSet name from T1Color to T2Color 
        Then we start t1 following with t2. Because the the code 
        in run() method is synchronized so we know that 
        t1 will change the color first. As a result, t2 can find T1Color 
        and change it to T2Color. This is what we expected. 
        
        However, if we remove the synchronization line, the result may be 
        unpredictable. To let the error case be triggered more easily, 
        I put a random sleep code in the run() method. Therefore, if 
        the critical codes were not protected. t2 can execute before 
        t1 by chance. In this case, the optionSet name is still Color 
        so t2 can not update the name to T2Color. This is a case to 
        demonstrate the data corruption without synchronization      
        The result is stored in ./testData/DriverOutoutWithoutSync and
        ./testData/DriverOutputWithSync
