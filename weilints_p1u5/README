Info: 
    This is a eclipse workspace directory. Please use eclipse to 
    load it.

    This Unit is mainly for client part. However, I changed the 
    package name from p1u4 to p1u5 so the server part is updated 
    as well. As a result, I provide both server part and client 
    part for TA to run. 

    There are two driver, one for client side, one for server side 
    client side:
        JavaSmartPhoneP1U5Client/src/javasmartphone/p1u5/client/AutoSocketClient.java
    server side:
        JavaSmartPhoneP1U5Server/src/javasmartphone/p1u5/server/AutoSocketServer.java

    Also, to web interface entry is (assume the TOMCAT is running on port 8080) 
    http://localhost:8080/JavaSmartPhoneP1U5Client/ListModels

    The functionality just align writeup. Please refer to the comments in each 
    file for details. Here only list some critical design motivation:
    
    The flow: 
    1. User use browser to acccess ListModels page, it will send GET request 
       to ListModels.java
    2. The ListModels.java will use doGet to handle the request. That is to say,
       communicate with server to list all automibile for uer selection.
    3. When user make a selection, it will send a GET resquest to ConfigureModel.java
    4. The ConfigureModel.java will communicate with sever to get automobile object 
    5. Then ConfigureModel.java will provide a form for user selection
    6. After selection, the ConfigureModel.java will send a POST request to itselt 
    7. In the doPost() method of ConfigureModel, it will make a configuration and 
       then send the object to ViewConfiguration.jsp to show.
