    Unit Test Code

    Test Code 
        testData/FordZTW.print_out
        testData/FordZTW.ser_out
        testData/FordZTW.txt

Important Node:
    Test:
        1. To test the functionality, the Driver class will read file from FordZTW.txt
           do the serilization output to FordZTW.ser_out and the do the de-serilization
           and print the message to see if the content is matached. FordZTW.print_out
           is the print result
        2. We also have unit test 
    Format of input file:
        1. Any line begin with "//" is comment. Will be skipped.
        2. The first valid line is model name and base price, separated by "," and no 
           additional spaces in between.
        3. The following line is an optionSet. Because it may contains multiple sets, this 
           maybe a lone line. Again, each item is separated by "," and no space is allowed.
           The first item is the name, e.g. "Color", following with "name,price" pairs.
